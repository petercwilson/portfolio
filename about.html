                    Hi, I'm Peter. I'm an apprentice fullstack web developer!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am a web development student in the Bloc coding bootcamp. I have many years of experience creating 
                    both HTML/CSS static websites as well as Wordpress sites. I believe in continually learning and challenging 
                    myself which is why I am taking the opportunity to learn fullstack development via the Bloc coding bootcamp.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am a Portland, Oregon native currently residing in San Diego, California. I have a beautiful wife of 10 years. 
                    I also have three awesome kids and a lazy dog. I'm an avid sports fan, a professional musician, 
                    a coffee aficianado and all-around technology enthusiast. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In my free time you'll find me coaching my kids baseball teams, reading books and catching up on Silicon Valley. I'm a 
                    proponent for a work/life balance that allows for hard work and hard play.
