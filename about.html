                    Hi, I'm Peter and I am a Web Developer!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Currently, I am completing the Full Stack JavaScript program at Bloc. I have many years of experience creating 
                    both handcoded HTML/CSS websites as well as working extensively with many different Wordpress sites. I am a continual learner and love to challenge 
                    myself which is why I am taking the opportunity to learn fullstack development from Bloc, Treehouse and Udemy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon but currently reside in beautiful Thousand Oaks, California which is right outside of Los Angeles county. 
                    I have a beautiful wife of 12 years who works as a Corporate account manager, three awesome kids keeping us busy, and a lazy Boston Terrier dog. I'm an avid sports fan, a professional musician, 
                    a coffee aficianado and all-around tech enthusiast. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In my free time you'll find me watching my kids baseball/basketball/football teams, reading books and rewatching Silicon Valley, Parks and Rec and the Marvel cinematic universe in chronological order (the only way). I'm a 
                    proponent for a work/life balance and believe that it's the only way to allow for meaningful work and quality family time.
